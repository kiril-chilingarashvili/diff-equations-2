    "### - $(3,0)$ and $(0, 1)$ are saddles whose incoming eigenlines lie along the axes.\n",

    "### Showing that all trajectories that start in the first quadrant are trapped in the first quadrant is part of validating our model, since $x$ and $y$ represent populations and do not make sense as negative numbers.\n",

    "### This means along each vertical line $x=c$ where $c>3$ trajectories are moving leftwards. And since trajectories are moving leftwards on all vertical lines to the right of $x=3$ any trajectory that starts to the right of $x=3$ can settle down only in the vertical strip $0\\leq x\\leq 3$ \n",
    "### Each of the vertical lines $x=c$ for $c>3$ behaves like a fence preventing any trajectory on its left to cross to its right. In general, a ***fence*** is a curve or a line on the phase plane that block trajectories from crossing from one (or both) side(s).\n",
    "![Plot](img/step-2.png)\n",
    "### So far, we can conclude that all trajectories in the first quadrant will eventually enter the vertical strip $0\\leq x\\leq 3$\n",
    "\n",
    "### ***No escape to the top***\n",
    "### In the region $0 \\leq x \\leq 3, y > 4$ the second DE of the system gives the following inequality:\n",
    "## $$ \\dot{y} = y - y^2 + xy \\leq y - y^2 + 3y = 4y - y^2 < 0 \\quad (0 \\leq x \\leq 3, y>4) $$\n",
    "### Hence, along all horizontal segments $y=d$ where $d>4$ and $0 \\leq x \\leq 3$, trajectories move downwards and can only settle down in the rectangle $y \\leq 4, 0 \\leq x \\leq 3$. Any horizontal segment $y=d$ for $d>4$ is a fence.\n",
    "![Plot](img/step-3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### (You might think you could fence in the trajectories from the top first and the right side second, but in fact, the order matters since we do need to first restrict to $x \\leq 3$ to get the inequality $y-y^2+xy \\leq 4y-y^2$ above.)\n",
    "### To summarize, there are fences on all four sides. There are the obvious ones which are trajectories: the positive $x$ and $y$-axes. There are also other curves, the vertical lines $x=c$ for $c>3$ and the horizontal segments $y=d$ for $d>4$ and $0 \\leq x \\leq 3$ which are not trajectories but nonetheless block trajectories from crossing from one side.\n",
    "### ***Conclusion***: All trajectories starting in the first quadrant, where $x>0, y>0$ eventually enter the finite rectangle $0 \\leq x \\leq 3, 0 \\leq y \\leq 4$ and stay there. This is small enough that a numerical simulation can now give supporting evidence that all trajectories starting in the first quadrant do tend to the stable critical point $(1, 2)$. We will use the mathlet below for the numerical simulation. There is a rigorous proof based on fences and finding shrinking regions that trapped the trajectories.\n"
