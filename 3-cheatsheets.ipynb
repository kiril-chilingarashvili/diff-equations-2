    "### and if the linearized system is ***structurally stable***, that is, it lies in one of the large regions in the trace-determinant plane, which correspond to saddles, nodes, and spirals, then the phase portrait of the ***original nonlinear system*** near $(a, b)$ looks like the phase portrait of the ***linearized system*** near $(0, 0)$. (We will not prove this, or even make precise what “looks like\" means.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recall the structurally unstable cases are borderline cases: the positive vertical axis, the parabola, and the horizontal axis. For example, if the linearized system is on the critical parabola, the nonlinear system could behave like a spiral, a node, or something in between.\n",
