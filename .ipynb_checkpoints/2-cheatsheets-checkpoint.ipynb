    "### ***Detailed Procedure***:\n",
    "### Draw the solution as a parametrized curve on the $(x,y)$-plane. In other words, plot the point $(x(t), y(t))$ for every real number $t$ (including negative $t$). The differential equation $ \\bf{\\dot{x}} = \\bf{A} \\bf{x} $ specifies which direction the point $(x(t), y(t))$ will move next (and how fast), in terms of its current position.\n",

    "\n",
    "### ***Solution***:\n",
    "### Since $\\lambda$ is real, $e^{\\lambda t}>0$ for all $t$. Therefore each point of the solution $\\bf{v} e^{\\lambda t}$ is a positive scalar multiple of $\\bf{v}$. This means the trajectory lies on the ray through the eigenvector $\\bf{v}$ The direction of the trajectory depends on the sign of $\\lambda$ as follow:\n",
    "### - If $\\lambda = 0$, the trajectory is a single point because $\\begin{pmatrix} x(t) \\\\ y(t) \\end{pmatrix} = \\bf{v} e^{\\lambda t} = \\bf{v}$ That is, the solution is stationary at the point $\\bf{v}$. The point $\\bf{v}$ is called a critical point since $\\bf{\\dot{x}} = 0$ there.\n",
    "### - If $\\lambda > 0$, the trajectory points towards infinity (is repelled from $(0,0)$).\n",
    "### - If $\\lambda < 0$, the trajectory points towards $(0,0)$ (is attracted to $(0,0)$).\n",

    "\n",
    "### ***Remark***: We can think of the trajectory as the footprint of the solution. It records all points on the $(x,y)$-plane that the solution $(x(t),y(t))$ reaches and in which direction. However, a trajectory does not describe a solution fully. It neither shows at what time each point is reached, nor contains information about speed."
