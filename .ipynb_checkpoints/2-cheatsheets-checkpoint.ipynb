    "### ***Detailed Procedure***:\n",
    "### Draw the solution as a parametrized curve on the $(x,y)$-plane. In other words, plot the point $(x(t), y(t))$ for every real number $t$ (including negative $t$). The differential equation $ \\bf{\\dot{x}} = \\bf{A} \\bf{x} $ specifies which direction the point $(x(t), y(t))$ will move next (and how fast), in terms of its current position.\n",
    "### ***Warm up***: trajectory of $\\bf{v} e^{\\lambda t}$\n",
    "### Recall that if $\\bf{v}$ is an eigenvector associated to a real eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of a matrix $\\bf{A}$, then $\\bf{v} e^{\\lambda t}$ is a solution to $ \\bf{\\dot{x}} = \\bf{A} \\bf{x} $. Sketch the trajectory of such a solution on the $(x, y)$-plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ***Solution***:\n",
    "### Since $\\lambda$ is real, $e^{\\lambda t}>0$ for all $t$. Therefore each point of the solution $\\bf{v} e^{\\lambda t}$ is a positive scalar multiple of $\\bf{v}$. This means the trajectory lies on the ray through the eigenvector $\\bf{v}$ The direction of the trajectory depends on the sign of $\\lambda$ as follow:\n",
    "### - If $\\lambda = 0$, the trajectory is a single point because $\\begin{pmatrix} x(t) \\\\ y(t) \\end{pmatrix} = \\bf{v} e^{\\lambda t} = \\bf{v}$ That is, the solution is stationary at the point $\\bf{v}$. The point $\\bf{v}$ is called a critical point since $\\bf{\\dot{x}} = 0$ there.\n",
    "### - If $\\lambda > 0$, the trajectory points towards infinity (is repelled from $(0,0)$).\n",
    "### - If $\\lambda < 0$, the trajectory points towards $(0,0)$ (is attracted to $(0,0)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here are the sketches of the trajectories for the three cases:\n",
    "![Sketch](img/diff-eq-sketch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ***Remark***: We can think of the trajectory as the footprint of the solution. It records all points on the $(x,y)$-plane that the solution $(x(t),y(t))$ reaches and in which direction. However, a trajectory does not describe a solution fully. It neither shows at what time each point is reached, nor contains information about speed."

    "### Because the system is overdamped $(b^2 > 4 k)$ both eigenvalues $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ are real and negative. So all solutions approach $0$ as time goes on, regardless of initial conditions. That is, the trajectories of all solutions approach the origin (in the $(x,y)$-plane).\n",
    "### Let us obtain more information on the qualitative behavior of solutions by comparing the two eigenvalues. Let $\\lambda_1 < \\lambda_2$ so that $\\lambda_1$ is the more negative eigenvalue. Denote the corresponding eigenvectors $\\bf{v_1}$ and $\\bf{v_2}$ Recall that for any specific eigenvector $\\bf{v_1}$ any scalar multiple $c\\bf{v_1}$ of it is also an eigenvector; so the set of all possible eigenvectors form a line. We will call such a line an ***eigenline***.\n",

    "### For the trajectories that are not along the eigenlines, note that because $\\lambda_1 < \\lambda_2 < 0$:\n",
    "### - When $t \\to \\infty$, $e^{\\lambda_1 t}$ is much smaller than $e^{\\lambda_2 t}$ so the term with $\\bf{v_2} e^{\\lambda_2 t}$ dominates. This means that as trajectories ***approach the origin***, they become tangent to the eigenline corresponding to the larger, less negative, eigenvalue $\\lambda_2$\n",
    "### - When $t \\to -\\infty$, $e^{\\lambda_1 t}$  is much greater than $e^{\\lambda_2 t}$ so the term with $\\bf{v_1} e^{\\lambda_1 t}$ dominates.
