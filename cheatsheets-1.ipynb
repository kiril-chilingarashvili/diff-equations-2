    "## Real life examples for homogenous linear systems of ODEs:\n",
    "\n",
    "### - ***Physics***: To send the Juno spacecraft to Jupiter, NASA scientists needed to understand the full system of gravitational attraction among the planets, and its effect on the velocity and acceleration of Juno. This gives rise to a system of differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - ***Electrical systems***: We have seen that an RLC circuit can be described by a single second order ODE. More complex circuits present in all electrical devices, such as computers and cell phones, are described by systems of differential equations.\n",

    "### - ***Chemical reactions***: The time derivative of the concentration of a chemical species is a function of the reaction rates and concentrations of other species. These relations give systems of DEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - ***Engineering***: Controlling robots, airplanes, and cars all require systems of differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - ***Computer graphics***: Life-like animations of fire, smoke, water, snow, and moving cloth in movies all require simulating systems of DEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - ***Gene expression network***: The time derivatives of mRNA and protein concentrations are functions of their degradation rates and transcription factors of the proteins. These relations constitute systems of DEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - ***Network dynamics***: How a virus spreads in a population, the flow of traffic, and information flow in a social network can all be described by systems of DEs."
